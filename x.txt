🏗️ Biashara Assistant — Multi-Industry Architecture
🔑 Core Principle
You are not building 7 bots.
You are building 1 platform with:
Shared infrastructure
Shared conversation engine
Industry-specific configs, flows, and rules

1️⃣ High-Level Architecture (Unchanged Core)
Customer (WhatsApp)
        |

  "features": {
    "booking": true,
    "walk_in": true,
    "payments": false,
    "reminders": true
  }
}

vs
{
  "industry": "church",
  "features": {
    "booking": false,
    "walk_in": false,
    "reminders": false,
    "events": true
  }
}

👉 Same engine, different switches.

5️⃣ AI Layer (Industry-Aware, Still Controlled)
AI prompt includes:
You are a WhatsApp assistant for a {industry_type} business.
Follow the approved flows.
Do not invent services or prices.
Escalate when unsure.

AI handles:
Intent detection
Language detection (EN/SW)
Natural phrasing
Logic still lives in your code.

6️⃣ Database Structure (Universal, Clean)
Core Tables

Optional / Industry Tables

7️⃣ Admin Dashboard (Industry-Adaptive UI)
Same dashboard, different sections appear:
Salon → “Appointments”
Clinic → “Appointments + Doctors”
Church → “Events”
School → “Inquiries”
Real Estate → “Leads”
This keeps UX simple.

8️⃣ Why This Architecture Is 🔥
One codebase
Easy onboarding
Easy sales pitch
Easy referrals
Easy to expand (lawyers, gyms, pharmacies next)
You are building a platform, not a chatbot.

9️⃣ Recommended Build Order (Founder-Smart)
1️⃣ Salon / Barber
2️⃣ Clinic
3️⃣ Real Estate
4️⃣ School
5️⃣ Hotel
6️⃣ Church
Each one reuses 80% of the system.


Abstract

Kenya represents one of the most dynamic mobile-first digital economies in the world, characterized by rapid smartphone adoption, widespread mobile payment usage, and extensive reliance on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp for business communication. As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly accessible, understanding the factors that influence trust and adoption among small business owners is critical. This project proposes an empirical study of a WhatsApp-based AI assistant designed and built by the researcher for small businesses in Kenya. Rather than prioritizing technical efficiency alone, the study centers on understanding the social, technical, and cultural factors that shape business owners’ trust in and willingness to adopt AI assistants for customer-facing interactions. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research combines system usage data with surveys and semi-structured interviews conducted before and after deployment. Secondary measures, such as response time and missed inquiries, are used to contextualize adoption outcomes. By examining real-world use in a fast-growing, mobile-first market, this project contributes to human-centered AI research and offers insights into designing trustworthy, culturally aligned AI systems for small businesses in the Global South.
